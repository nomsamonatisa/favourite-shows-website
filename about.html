<h2>About This Website</h2>
<p>This website is a fan-made project to showcase my favorite TV shows such as FBI, S.W.A.T., The Rookie, and more.</p>
<p>It was created as a learning project using HTML and CSS. I love crime, action, and drama series that combine teamwork and justice. Each show has its own dedicated page with images and descriptions.</p>
